# TODO
- Leaderboard

# WIP
- Players status (Finish but not that much)
- Total online players (Show in Server status but we need to know who online?)
- Funny commands like `commands/utility/between.js` need more deatils.

# Finished
- Linked discord account with bancho.py
- Server Status
- My profile to confirm discord link with bancho
  
# How to setup
clone this repo and `npm i` OR `yarn add`

You must run `node deploy-commands.js` before `node .` or `node index` because if not, slash command will won't be imported!

# What you need?
- MYSQL
- BANCHO.PY
- GMAIL ACCOUNT (Google workspace, with less secure enabled)
